# GCP

This is my first project with the use of Google Cloud Platform(GCP).

The app engine is deployed to Google Cloud and its functionality can be found in the API Specification.

Updated: The code works fine when it is hosted by local computer. However, the URL links to an error page possibly because the termination of the service after I leave the organization due to graduation.

Several functionalities require user authentication implemented with Auth0.

You may test it by importing 2 JSON files to Postman.
